Using GitHub's project management features, like milestones, issues, and project boards, greatly improves teamwork and organization. These tools help the team break down big tasks into smaller, manageable pieces, making it easier for everyone to stay focused on common goals.

Milestones act as important checkpoints in our project timeline. They help the team concentrate on key deliverables and deadlines. By setting clear goals for each milestone, team members can prioritize their work and track their progress effectively. Issues allow the team to record bugs, feature requests, and tasks, promoting transparency and accountability. Each team member can take responsibility for specific issues, encouraging them to solve problems proactively.

The project board visually shows the status of each task, making it easy to see what is pending, in progress, or completed. This clarity helps communication within the team, as everyone can quickly see where help might be needed or where focus should be directed.

I havent faced any challenges when implementing these tools in my project beacuse i had only done this all for experiment project and didnt connect with any other team so i think i will find challenges in future
